You should be able to **run** mikidown with <code>./mikidown.py</code>.

Open any terminal and issue command  <code>mikidown</code> to bring Mikidown up.

## Use Mikidown to visualize you notes


You can find this file in the menu: *Help->README*.

If you are unfamiliar with markdown, you can use this file as a simple reference to basic markdown syntax.

However, I suggest you take a look at the complete [Markdown Syntax].

Changes made by me:
* Properly support relative URLS
* use wiki:// to indicate a link within the notebook
* Fix PDF support

## Helps needed
