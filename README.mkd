## Beautiful notes powered by markdown

In case you are unfamiliar with markdown, you can use this file (**Help->README**) as a simple reference to basic markdown syntax. However, I suggest you take a look at the complete [Markdown Syntax].

### Markdown extension

All python-markdown [extensions] are supported. To enable/disable extension, edit the `notebook.conf` file in your notebook folder.

    # notebook_folder/notebook.conf
    extensions=nl2br, strkundr, codehilite, fenced_code, headerid, headerlink, footnotes

### Mikidown Specific Syntax

1.  page cross link
    - `[text](/parentNode/childNode/pageName)`
    - `[text](/parentNode/childNode/pageName#anchor)`


2.  absolute and relative image path 
    - `![text](file:///home/user/pic.png)` 
    - `![text](pic.png)`     # path relative to notebook folder
    - `Ctrl + I` or **Edit -> Insert Image** will bring up an **insert image** dialog.

3.  ins/del/bold/italics
    - `~~delete~~`  will yield <del>delete</del>
    - `__insert__` will yield <ins>insert</ins>
    - `**strong**` will yield <strong>strong</strong>
    - `//emphasis//` will yield <em>emphasis</em>
